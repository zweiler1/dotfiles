# noctalia-supergfxctl

Minimum noctalia version: `3.8.2`

Brings GPU control to your noctalia shell.  
Available modes are detected automatically. Current mode is highlighted in the main color, pending mode will be in tertiary.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `supergfxctl` may not always report reliable information about the pending mode or the action required to apply it.
> The plugin can optionally **guess the needed action** (generally logout, reboot, or none) required after switching GPU modes. This behavior is controlled by the **`Guess fallback action`** option.

Made possible by [supergfxctl](https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/supergfxctl).  
Thanks [asusctl](https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/asusctl), [rog-control-center](https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/asusctl/-/tree/main/rog-control-center) for code inspiration.
